# Data_Wrangling_Tips_Tricks
### Find the solution of most common data wrangling problems

70 to 80% of our time in an analytical/ data science project is spent on data preparation. Whether working with structured or unstructured data, there are a few data-wrangling scenarios that we can't solve directly using standard package functions. This repository will provide you with solutions to such scenarios. 
Each folder in the repository will have 3 files:
- Sample data file (generally .csv) 
- A *jupyter* notebook containing the solution
- A text file with the link to my **Medium** blog post where the explanation of the solution is documented

WhatsApp me on 9620627282 for any data wrangling problem you encounter and I will revert within 48 hrs.

Happy Learning!!!

# Data_Wrangling_Tips_Tricks
### Find the solution to the most common data wrangling problems

Most of our time in an analytical/ data science project is spent on data preparation. Whether working with structured or unstructured data, there are a few data-wrangling scenarios that we can't solve directly using standard package functions. This repository will provide you with solutions to such scenarios. 
Each folder in the repository will have 3 files:

- A *jupyter* notebook containing the solution
- A text file with the link to my **Medium** blog post where the explanation of the solution is documented

List of Scenarios covered:

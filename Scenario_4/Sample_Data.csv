impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period

severity of these consequences as well as their impact on the financial position and results of future periods. randolph pinna ceo of the company stated the second quarter of 2020 was a tale of two contrasting stories. the first half continued the strong performance that was demonstrated in q1 coupled with a complete reversal of fortune in the second half as the impact of the novel coronavirus impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period

sedar profile at www.sedar.com. on march 11 2020 the world health organization who officially declared covid 19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus a pandemic. as a result of measures to curtail covid 19 the company closed all of its retail locations on or around march 24 2020 and they remained closed at april 30 2020 with the majority of the retail employees furloughed. in addition many of its commercial customers have been impacted by the pandemic resulting in reduced demand for banknotes. while the company continues to operate it is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences as well as their impact on the financial position and results of future periods. randolph pinna ceo of the company stated the second quarter of 2020 was a tale of two contrasting stories. the first half continued the strong performance that was demonstrated in q1 coupled with a complete reversal of fortune in the second half as the impact of the novel coronavirus impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period

3,10,6/11/2020,filed bankruptcy, june 11 2020 globe newswire currency exchange international corp. the company tsx cxi otcbb curn announces its financial results and management discussion and analysis md a for the three and six month periods ended april 30 2020 all figures are in u.s. dollars except where otherwise indicated . the complete financial statements and md a can be found on the company sedar profile at www.sedar.com. on march 11 2020 the world health organization who officially declared covid 19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus a pandemic. as a result of measures to curtail covid 19 the company closed all of its retail locations on or around march 24 2020 and they remained closed at april 30 2020 with the majority of the retail employees furloughed. in addition many of its commercial customers have been impacted by the pandemic resulting in reduced demand for banknotes. while the company continues to operate it is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences as well as their impact on the financial position and results of future periods. randolph pinna ceo of the company stated the second quarter of 2020 was a tale of two contrasting stories. the first half continued the strong performance that was demonstrated in q1 coupled with a complete reversal of fortune in the second half as the impact of the novel coronavirus impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period ended april 30 2020 compared to the three month period ended april 30 2019 during the three month period ended april 30 2020 transactional banknote activity between the company and its customers

of the coronavirus shutdowns net operating loss of 2.3 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 compared to 1.1 million in net income the three month period ended april 30 2019. normalizing for the adoption of ifrs 16 on november 1 2019 the net operating loss would have been 3.0 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 the net operating loss included a provision for loss of a receivable in the amount of 1.0 million owed by a customer which filed for bankruptcy protection net loss of 3 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 as compared to a net profit of 0.5 million for the three month period ended april 30 2019 and net loss per share of 0.47 on a basic and fully diluted basis for the three month period ended april 30 2020 versus earnings per share of 0.08 in the three month period ended april 30 2019. financial highlights for the six month period ended april 30 2020 compared to the six month period ended april 30 2019 during the six

operating year there is seasonality to the company operations with higher revenues generated from march until september and lower revenues from october to february. this coincides with peak tourism seasons in north america when there are generally more travelers entering and leaving the united states and canada. the coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted the ability for people to travel and therefore the three month period ending april 30 2020 is not indicative of typical seasonality. selected financial data three months endingrevenuenet operating incomenet income loss total

3,13,6/11/2020,filed bankruptcy, june 11 2020 globe newswire currency exchange international corp. the company tsx cxi otcbb curn announces its financial results and management discussion and analysis md a for the three and six month periods ended april 30 2020 all figures are in u.s. dollars except where otherwise indicated . the complete financial statements and md a can be found on the company sedar profile at www.sedar.com. on march 11 2020 the world health organization who officially declared covid 19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus a pandemic. as a result of measures to curtail covid 19 the company closed all of its retail locations on or around march 24 2020 and they remained closed at april 30 2020 with the majority of the retail employees furloughed. in addition many of its commercial customers have been impacted by the pandemic resulting in reduced demand for banknotes. while the company continues to operate it is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences as well as their impact on the financial position and results of future periods. randolph pinna ceo of the company stated the second quarter of 2020 was a tale of two contrasting stories. the first half continued the strong performance that was demonstrated in q1 coupled with a complete reversal of fortune in the second half as the impact of the novel coronavirus impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period

for loss of a receivable in the amount of 1.0 million owed by a customer which filed for bankruptcy protection net loss of 3 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 as compared to a net profit of 0.5 million for the three month period ended april 30 2019 and net loss per share of 0.47 on a basic and fully diluted basis for the three month period ended april 30 2020 versus earnings per share of 0.08 in the three month period ended april 30 2019. financial highlights for the six month period ended april 30 2020 compared to the six month period ended april 30 2019 during the six

3,16,6/11/2020,filed bankruptcy, june 11 2020 globe newswire currency exchange international corp. the company tsx cxi otcbb curn announces its financial results and management discussion and analysis md a for the three and six month periods ended april 30 2020 all figures are in u.s. dollars except where otherwise indicated . the complete financial statements and md a can be found on the company sedar profile at www.sedar.com. on march 11 2020 the world health organization who officially declared covid 19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus a pandemic. as a result of measures to curtail covid 19 the company closed all of its retail locations on or around march 24 2020 and they remained closed at april 30 2020 with the majority of the retail employees furloughed. in addition many of its commercial customers have been impacted by the pandemic resulting in reduced demand for banknotes. while the company continues to operate it is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences as well as their impact on the financial position and results of future periods. randolph pinna ceo of the company stated the second quarter of 2020 was a tale of two contrasting stories. the first half continued the strong performance that was demonstrated in q1 coupled with a complete reversal of fortune in the second half as the impact of the novel coronavirus impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period

for loss of a receivable in the amount of 1.0 million owed by a customer which filed for bankruptcy protection net loss of 3 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 as compared to a net profit of 0.5 million for the three month period ended april 30 2019 and net loss per share of 0.47 on a basic and fully diluted basis for the three month period ended april 30 2020 versus earnings per share of 0.08 in the three month period ended april 30 2019. financial highlights for the six month period ended april 30 2020 compared to the six month period ended april 30 2019 during the six

3,19,6/11/2020,filed bankruptcy, june 11 2020 globe newswire currency exchange international corp. the company tsx cxi otcbb curn announces its financial results and management discussion and analysis md a for the three and six month periods ended april 30 2020 all figures are in u.s. dollars except where otherwise indicated . the complete financial statements and md a can be found on the company sedar profile at www.sedar.com. on march 11 2020 the world health organization who officially declared covid 19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus a pandemic. as a result of measures to curtail covid 19 the company closed all of its retail locations on or around march 24 2020 and they remained closed at april 30 2020 with the majority of the retail employees furloughed. in addition many of its commercial customers have been impacted by the pandemic resulting in reduced demand for banknotes. while the company continues to operate it is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences as well as their impact on the financial position and results of future periods. randolph pinna ceo of the company stated the second quarter of 2020 was a tale of two contrasting stories. the first half continued the strong performance that was demonstrated in q1 coupled with a complete reversal of fortune in the second half as the impact of the novel coronavirus impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period ended april 30 2020 compared to the three month period ended april 30 2019 during the three month period ended april 30 2020 transactional banknote activity between the company and its customers

of the coronavirus shutdowns net operating loss of 2.3 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 compared to 1.1 million in net income the three month period ended april 30 2019. normalizing for the adoption of ifrs 16 on november 1 2019 the net operating loss would have been 3.0 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 the net operating loss included a provision for loss of a receivable in the amount of 1.0 million owed by a customer which filed for bankruptcy protection net loss of 3 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 as compared to a net profit of 0.5 million for the three month period ended april 30 2019 and net loss per share of 0.47 on a basic and fully diluted basis for the three month period ended april 30 2020 versus earnings per share of 0.08 in the three month period ended april 30 2019. financial highlights for the six month period ended april 30 2020 compared to the six month period ended april 30 2019 during the six

operating year there is seasonality to the company operations with higher revenues generated from march until september and lower revenues from october to february. this coincides with peak tourism seasons in north america when there are generally more travelers entering and leaving the united states and canada. the coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted the ability for people to travel and therefore the three month period ending april 30 2020 is not indicative of typical seasonality. selected financial data three months endingrevenuenet operating incomenet income loss total

3,22,6/11/2020,filed bankruptcy, june 11 2020 globe newswire currency exchange international corp. the company tsx cxi otcbb curn announces its financial results and management discussion and analysis md a for the three and six month periods ended april 30 2020 all figures are in u.s. dollars except where otherwise indicated . the complete financial statements and md a can be found on the company sedar profile at www.sedar.com. on march 11 2020 the world health organization who officially declared covid 19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus a pandemic. as a result of measures to curtail covid 19 the company closed all of its retail locations on or around march 24 2020 and they remained closed at april 30 2020 with the majority of the retail employees furloughed. in addition many of its commercial customers have been impacted by the pandemic resulting in reduced demand for banknotes. while the company continues to operate it is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences as well as their impact on the financial position and results of future periods. randolph pinna ceo of the company stated the second quarter of 2020 was a tale of two contrasting stories. the first half continued the strong performance that was demonstrated in q1 coupled with a complete reversal of fortune in the second half as the impact of the novel coronavirus impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period ended april 30 2020 compared to the three month period ended april 30 2019 during the three month period ended april 30 2020 transactional banknote activity between the company and its customers

of the coronavirus shutdowns net operating loss of 2.3 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 compared to 1.1 million in net income the three month period ended april 30 2019. normalizing for the adoption of ifrs 16 on november 1 2019 the net operating loss would have been 3.0 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 the net operating loss included a provision for loss of a receivable in the amount of 1.0 million owed by a customer which filed for bankruptcy protection net loss of 3 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 as compared to a net profit of 0.5 million for the three month period ended april 30 2019 and net loss per share of 0.47 on a basic and fully diluted basis for the three month period ended april 30 2020 versus earnings per share of 0.08 in the three month period ended april 30 2019. financial highlights for the six month period ended april 30 2020 compared to the six month period ended april 30 2019 during the six

operating year there is seasonality to the company operations with higher revenues generated from march until september and lower revenues from october to february. this coincides with peak tourism seasons in north america when there are generally more travelers entering and leaving the united states and canada. the coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted the ability for people to travel and therefore the three month period ending april 30 2020 is not indicative of typical seasonality. selected financial data three months endingrevenuenet operating incomenet income loss total

3,25,6/11/2020,filed bankruptcy, june 11 2020 globe newswire currency exchange international corp. the company tsx cxi otcbb curn announces its financial results and management discussion and analysis md a for the three and six month periods ended april 30 2020 all figures are in u.s. dollars except where otherwise indicated . the complete financial statements and md a can be found on the company sedar profile at www.sedar.com. on march 11 2020 the world health organization who officially declared covid 19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus a pandemic. as a result of measures to curtail covid 19 the company closed all of its retail locations on or around march 24 2020 and they remained closed at april 30 2020 with the majority of the retail employees furloughed. in addition many of its commercial customers have been impacted by the pandemic resulting in reduced demand for banknotes. while the company continues to operate it is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences as well as their impact on the financial position and results of future periods. randolph pinna ceo of the company stated the second quarter of 2020 was a tale of two contrasting stories. the first half continued the strong performance that was demonstrated in q1 coupled with a complete reversal of fortune in the second half as the impact of the novel coronavirus impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period ended april 30 2020 compared to the three month period ended april 30 2019 during the three month period ended april 30 2020 transactional banknote activity between the company and its customers

normalizing for the adoption of ifrs 16 on november 1 2019 the net operating loss would have been 3.0 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 the net operating loss included a provision for loss of a receivable in the amount of 1.0 million owed by a customer which filed for bankruptcy protection net loss of 3 million in the three month period ended april 30 2020 as compared to a net profit of 0.5 million for the three month period ended april 30 2019 and net loss per share of 0.47 on a basic and fully diluted basis for the three month period ended april 30 2020 versus earnings per share of 0.08 in the three month period ended april 30 2019. financial highlights for the six month period ended april 30 2020 compared to the six month period ended april 30 2019 during the six

md a for the three and six month periods ended april 30 2020 all figures are in u.s. dollars except where otherwise indicated . the complete financial statements and md a can be found on the company sedar profile at www.sedar.com. on march 11 2020 the world health organization who officially declared covid 19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus a pandemic. as a result of measures to curtail covid 19 the company closed all of its retail locations on or around march 24 2020 and they remained closed at april 30 2020 with the majority of the retail employees furloughed. in addition many of its commercial customers have been impacted by the pandemic resulting in reduced demand for banknotes. while the company continues to operate it is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences as well as their impact on the financial position and results of future periods. randolph pinna ceo of the company stated the second quarter of 2020 was a tale of two contrasting stories. the first half continued the strong performance that was demonstrated in q1 coupled with a complete reversal of fortune in the second half as the impact of the novel coronavirus impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period

sedar profile at www.sedar.com. on march 11 2020 the world health organization who officially declared covid 19 the disease caused by a novel coronavirus a pandemic. as a result of measures to curtail covid 19 the company closed all of its retail locations on or around march 24 2020 and they remained closed at april 30 2020 with the majority of the retail employees furloughed. in addition many of its commercial customers have been impacted by the pandemic resulting in reduced demand for banknotes. while the company continues to operate it is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences as well as their impact on the financial position and results of future periods. randolph pinna ceo of the company stated the second quarter of 2020 was a tale of two contrasting stories. the first half continued the strong performance that was demonstrated in q1 coupled with a complete reversal of fortune in the second half as the impact of the novel coronavirus impacted strongly and swiftly. as a result of the travel restrictions and stay at home orders cxi suffered a dramatic decline in the demand to exchange foreign banknotes. while some of our retail locations have recently reopened we face a period of uncertainty before a return to pre crisis volumes. accordingly we have implemented cost reduction actions and are planning a sustainable path forward as we look out to the next fiscal year and beyond. cxi has a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity to allow us to weather this storm as we reposition the business for the new normal that lies ahead. our payments business continues to grow and we expect it to become a larger proportion of our revenue in the future. we believe that cxi will emerge as a leader in the industry as weaker competitors fade away and more financial institutions seek us out to become their solution provider because of our unique set of capabilities. financial highlights for the three month period
